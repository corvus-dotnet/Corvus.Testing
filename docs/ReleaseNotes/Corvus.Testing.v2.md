# Release notes for Corvus.Testing v2.

## v2.0

The main change is that we now target .NET 6.0. There are no functional changes. The more extensive nullability annotations available in more recent library versions may mean that upgrading to this version will cause more nullability warnings in your code, but other than that, this should be a low-impact upgrade.
